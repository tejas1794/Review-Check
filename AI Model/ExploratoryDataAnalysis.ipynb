(Link here: [[ASIN:B004TJ6JH6 NEEWER® 160 LED CN-160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Digital Camera / Camcorder Video Light, LED Light for Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Panasonic,SONY, Samsung and Olympus Digital SLR Cameras]])  They\\'re essentially the same price, but this one from Selens is much brighter and has more features.<br /><br />Pros:<br />✅ Stunningly bright.<br />✅ Solid, quality feel.  Not like the Neewer light, which felt pretty cheap and plasticy.<br />✅ Easy to adjust brightness using dial. (see my video)<br />✅ Gels (filters) are very useful. Cuts the glare.<br />✅ Versatile: You can use lots of different kinds of batteries.  I personally use my Canon 70D batteries, since I have a lot of those already.  You can also use 6X AA batteries (not included).<br />✅ Hot shoe mount fits my Canon 70D beautifully.<br />✅ As far as I can tell, there\\'s no high-pitched whine like I hear on other LED lights.<br />✅ Very nice people at Selens. They actually sent me this light to test and video review.<br /><br />Cons:<br />🍅 Does not get hot.  My bacon stayed limp and never crisped whilst laying upon it.  Though it still smelled like Christmas.<br /><br />Summary: 5/5 stars. The best bang for your buck when it comes to a portable lighting system for your filming.',\n",

       " (\"Trail of Dead is the second Scarlett Bernard Novel.  I read and reviewed the first novel, Dead Spots, in October of 2012.<br /><br />Sometimes a second book is a let down.  That is not true of Trail of Dead.  If anything it is even better that Dead Spots.  One of the things that struck me this time was how two different authors can take the same premise and write books that are completely different.  In the Alexia Tarabotti novels by Gail Carriger Alexia can negate supernatural powers or when near vampires and werewolves they become normal humans.  Scarlett does the same but the stories and characters are completely different.  The fact that it took me two books to even make the comparison is proof of that.<br /><br />The world building was done in Dead Spots.  The main characters are the same. Jesse, Scarlett and Eli are all part of the story but the focus has moved from Jesse and Eli to Scarlett.  Trail of Dead builds from the foundation laid in Dead Spots.  Again the writing is excellent, the plot well developed, the characters well drawn and tension builds to a satisfying conclusion.  Again, there were some unexpected twists and turns.  This book was based on a problem character from book one.  That character is now gone.  Trail of Dead could be the last Scarlett Bernard Novel but I am hoping that I saw a small set up for the next book.  I will certainly be on the look out and hoping that the series will continue.<br /><br />Trail of Dead is scheduled for publication June 4, 2013.  I received an advanced reader's copy review copy of Trail of Dead from Amazon Vine.  You should pre-order your copy now.\",\n",

It is waterproof so if you have bed-wetters, etc. , this will provide protection.<br /><br />It is machine washable but I would hang it to dry so you don't damage the vinyl.

These are people who are in the right job and contribute positively to the organizations culture.<br /><br />Then multiply that number by the condition of your organizations relationship.  Relationships between employees, between management and labor, between the organization and its customers and suppliers.<br /><br />The perfect number you can have is 1000, but that is probably impossible.  A number of 729 means you are running at full power.  500 to 700 means you are doing pretty well.  Below 500 you need to do some work.<br /><br />That is the premise of the Power Score.  The book is written in a question and answer format, the authors asking the questions they believe the reader would ask and then answering them.  It actually makes for an easy read and makes it easy to explain some of their more complex thoughts.  Overall there is nothing earth shattering in this book, it all comes down to basic common business sense, the authors just organize it in very thoughtful way, and they support all of their claims with references a large pool of research they are pulling from.  They offer ideas and strategies to improve your score in all three of the categories.<br /><br />So I don’t think this book offers any earth shattering ideas, it is full of a lot of good ones.

The human eye can recognize irregularities at that level and errors can destroy the aesthetics of the project.  I thought about getting a set of Groz calipers that comes with a divider, but I already had inside and outside calipers and i didn\\'t want to spend $50 just to get a divider.  Then i came by this EKG caliper as an Amazon add-on for $6.31 so i got it.<br /><br />These calipers are great.  they are very well made and very sturdy.  Their maximum span is 7.5\", but the effective usable span is more like 7\", so they\\'re not well suited for cabinet work, cutting sheet stock, and wood turning.  But for precision joinery, laying out dovetail joints, duplicating precise dado\\'s, etc. these are just the ticket.  The arm tension is adjustable via two small set screws, and the points are replaceable.  These points are sharp and may also serve as an occasional light-duty scribe.  The points are protected with a convenient hard plastic cover which works fine.  My cover fits tightly enough to stay on in my pocket, but caliper placement in woodworking is primarily an out-of-pocket experience, so tightness doesn\\'t matter much.<br /><br />At $6 these calipers are a great deal for anyone who needs to measure, transfer or step off small distances, scribe small circles, create simple geometrical patterns, etc.  The advantages over standard flat leg dividers for woodworking are that these dividers are precision-made, the points are ground to a precise center, and that they firmly hold their span for duplicating measurements, where most of woodworking dividers I\\'m familiar with use a threaded cap to hold the span which is far less convenient.  This would also be useful in metalworking small objects on mills, lathes, etc. which I don\\'t do any more.  It will not replace the Trammel point - but for smallmeasurement, this is simpler and more accurate.<br /><br />This might also be useful with navigational charts, small part duplication, accurate metalworking, etc.  A very inexpensive and handy tool well beyond its intended uses.',\n",

       " ('The ZAQ Dew Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser is a fun, modern way to eliminate the odors in your home.  The simple sleek design is very eye catching and setup took only a few minutes.  Pull the diffuser out of the box, fill with water from the measuring cup provided, add 3-4 drops of scented oils (not provided), plug it in, push the button, and presto! --  your house is smelling fantastic!  I had a few friends over right after I got the diffuser and they loved the fact that it changed colors and were instantly intrigued by the design. The device has an auto shutoff (when it runs out of water) as well and you can also adjust it so that it will scent but not have the light. The only thing I do warn about is that unless you are trying to do a quick coverup of your stinky kitchen, perhaps only use 2 drops of oil and be sure to put the machine away from any food.  The first few times I ran the diffuser I set it on the kitchen table and, while eating a quick snack, I found myself being a bit overwhelmed by the scent. After moving it to a different spot and adding a little less oil, I find that it works much better.<br /><br />I love scented products and have used many different types for creating that ambiance and atmosphere throughout my home. This one adds moisture to dry air as well, which is especially great during the winter months. This diffuser would make a lovely gift.',\n",

The sound of the wheels on the cracks in the concrete make her go crazy and she barks and even tries to lunge at the rider. NOT OKAY. I've had to use it a few times already and it really helps to snap her out of her frenzy. As soon as I spot a skateboarder coming, I stay calm and prepare to click as soon as she shows signs that she's spotted the skateboard, then I give her a command to sit and stay. Once it has passed I make her keep sitting and not move until she is calm like nothing happened. So far this has worked, I hope she will eventually learn to ignore skateboarders without needing the clicker.<br /><br />I've also started using it to help train her to not jump on me when I walk in the door, which is another big problem. This hasn't been as successful as with the skateboard situation. Probably because she's just so excited to see me, but I'm hoping over time it will begin to sink in that she must sit and stay calm before I can pet her.<br /><br />Overall, combined with proper training commands, I would recommend.\",\n",

Because the price is right, I decided to give it a try - If this was no better than the others we have tried, I was only out a few dollars.<br /><br />Well, this sharpener is amazing! I cannot believe how well it works. I took the dullest knives we had, set this sharpener on the counter top facing up, and then ran a knife through the slot a few times. you could feel the bite of the sharpening stone against the blade and actually see metal filings falling onto the counter top. This thing was doing some serious work. After 4 swipes or so, I cleaned off the blade and tried to run it through a ripe tomato I had on the counter - wow - just like using a razor blade on the tomato. It sliced through like butter. This knife has never been so sharp. I did all my knives with the same results.<br /><br />This is an amazing sharpener. The directions are simple.

Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either.

       " (\"I needed an insulated coffee mug, so I got several brands to try out. This Epare is my favorite by far. It's a generous size and attractive design. It's as rugged as these can be and has lasted quite well. It hasn't leaked at all so far although I always hand wash it since it's so quick that way. I confess I broke one when I tipped over a blender jar and it unfortunately landed on my Epare but I can't blame the mug at all for that. It keeps my morning coffee nice and hot a lot longer than my other non-insulated mugs. One thing I noticed is you don't want to fill it all the way to the top or a little drips down the side with the first few sips. Just leave a half inch and you should be OK. It has this in common with the other brands I tried. I liked these enough to buy another set. Hope you enjoy them also.\",\n",

       " ('I have been interested in making my own sausage for a while now, which meant I needed a meat grinder.  I was tempted by those big metal hand-cranked grinders just because they look cool, but finally decided on function over form and got this Food Grinder attachment for my KitchenAid, along with the [[ASIN:B00004SGFQ Sausage Stuffer]].  I know that this grinder has been hit-and-miss with a lot of people.  I did some research on how best to use it, and followed the advice of chilling both the meat and the grinder before use.  I cut my meat into small, serviceable chunks and I was ready to go.  I am happy to report that I am on the \"hit\" side of hit-and-miss.  Both the grinder and sausage stuffer worked just fine, and I had a great time making my sausage.  Granted, everything wasn\\'t entirely smooth; it took some practice and experience to get used to just how much meat I could put in the grinder at once, how fast I could run the mixer, and how much pressure I could exert on the plunger to keep the meat grinding steady into the sausage casings.  If I pressed to hard or went to fast, the meat had a tendency to squish up the sides.  I did have a slight residue of that famous \"food safe grease\" on the grinder after I was finished, but it was a tiny amount and didn\\'t get on the meat.  I wonder if chilling the actual grinder before using it helped out with that problem?  Either way it washed off easily.  I wouldn\\'t recommend the \"KitchenAid Food Grinder\" for anyone doing heavy-duty mince-making.  This is not a commercial-grade product, and doing more than a few pounds is going to take a long time.  But for someone like me who just wants to add a new menu item to what can come out of their kitchen, it works just fine.',\n",

Most of us have several of them. Like rabbits, they seem to multiply over time. And they get larger--much larger. What was 250 GB the day before yesterday was 500 GB yesterday and a terabyte today. The more they hold, the more we stand to lose if they are dropped and the data is not backed up elsewhere.<br /><br />Sadly, the portable drives that carry around our prized possessions (photos, music, videos, data files, etc.) often go unprotected. (True, some portable hard drives come with cases of sorts--but, really, how good is their protection?) And consider how many portable drives we purchase that come with no case at all. Nothing to protect that which is protecting our valuable data. How can this be allowed?<br /><br />Apparently, the folks at Amazon have recognized this shortcoming and have offered us a solution in the AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Case for My Passport Essential. The case feels rugged enough and while it doesn't offer a great deal of padding, the webbing and elastic drive strap inside may help in the event of a few minors falls. The case has a stiff outer shell that may provide some additional protection. Most importantly, you have something to keep your portable drive housed in while it is not in use.<br /><br />Although they do vary a bit in size and shape, most modern portable drives seem close to being the same form factor. That led me to wonder why Amazon singled out the Passport Essential Drive for this case. Was it some cross advertising deal with Western Digital? Was it that they plan to offer an entire line of AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Cases each intended for a specific manufacture's model? So, in the interest of science, I conducted an experiment to see what other portable drives might fit in this case. I gathered my portable drives togetherand tried each one individually in the carrying case that I had received. Here are my results:<br /><br />* Maxtor 320 GB (very old drive) - Too large to fit<br />* OWC Mercury 250 GB - Too large to fit (besides it comes with its own leather case)<br />* Seagate Expansion 500 GB- Too long to fit<br />* Seagate FreeAgent Go 640 GB - Too large to fit (besides it comes with its own case)<br />* WD Elements Portable SE 320 GB - It fits, but it is a very tight squeeze<br />* Toshiba 640 GB - Fits perfectly<br />* WD My Passport 500 GB - Fits and actually is a bit small for the case<br />* WD My Passort Essential 1 TB - Fits perfectly (as was expected)<br />* WD My Passport Studio 500 GB - Too large to fit<br />* Apple iPhone 3GS - Fits perfectly (it's not a hard drive, but I just had to give the iPhone a try)<br /><br />(* No drives were intentionally harmed during this testing.)&#34;\",\n",

One year I ended up with some sort of tarp that we ended up using for our barbecue because no one claimed it.  The Classic cover is going nowhere fast and has a lot of great qualities that make it worth while for anyone with a built-in barbecue to invest in.  We don’t have a built-in, but still can use the cover.<br /><br />What’s great about it are the two Velcro straps beneath the cover that will secure it to the barbecue.  Along the edges the material is elasticized, another factor that will keep it from flying away.  If it does, the barbecue will have to go with it because it’s that secure.  The cover itself is a thick, sturdy 100% woven polyester with a rubberized lining.  This is the type of polyester that I see in backpacks an luggage.<br /><br />There are even some gussets with small circles that will help keep the Classic cover in place when there are heavy gusts of wind.  We do have those and that’s when we sometimes find an odd assortment of things in our yard.  The gussets will divert those gusts, keeping them from pulling the cover up into the air.  The cover will not only protect the barbecue from the elements, but make it easier to clean.<br /><br />The cover is water-resistant and very well-sewn and designed.  Installation, if you want to call it that, only takes a minute and is intuitive.  This is nothing like those cheap, lightweight tarps that blow away, tear, or get holes in them quickly.  It would take a long time to get any wear on this tarp from putting it on and off.  This is definitely a sturdy, well-made tarp that will protect a barbecue.',\n",

Remembering how much the cats I had as a kid loved sitting in the window, this seemed like it would be a good fit.  When it arrived, my first impression was that it was easy to assemble and install, looked attractive, and seemed very comfortable.  Under the cover is a layer of egg-crate style foam with what seems to be a waterproof layer over that.  Then comes the actual cover and bolster.  The cover is soft and plush and the bolster is covered with a smooth fabric.  This all fits over a plastic frame.  While the frame doesn't feel overly heavy-duty, it does seem adequate.  Our cat is pretty small, only about six pounds, so I can't say how this would hold up to a 20 pound cat.<br /><br />There are two ways to install this.  You can use the enclosed screws and simply screw them into the window sill.  Slide the cover over and you're done.  This is what we did.  Also, there are two velcro strips, though I can't say how they would work.  I would imagine the tapes from Command hooks could be a possibility for damage-free installation, too.  The velcro (and Command tapes) need to sit for a time before you use the product.<br /><br />The bolster is always shown on the window side, which seems backward to me, but you can put the cover on with the bolster either side.  The bolster also zips off.  Our cat likes to sit on the perch, back away from the window against the bolster.  She seems quite comfortable, spends a lot of time there, and has made herself comfortable in her new home.  We are happy with our decision and would highly recommend this product.\",\n",

It had to be assembled, and apart from some rudimentary instructions on the label, there were no directions to show us clearly how to put it together. However, this only took a few minutes. On unpacking, my initial feeling was that it looked rather flimsy, but now that it is assembled, it seems a neat,sturdy and well-designed pet carrier. Our previous carrier was not well put-together, and it was always a struggle to get our cat installed. I wanted one which would make travelling to the vet or to the cattery as stress-free for her as possible, and this one ticks all the boxes.\",\n",

It's priced to compete with similarly priced NAD, Rotel, and Parasound offerings, but frankly, it's in a different galaxy from those products.<br /><br />Before expressing more praise for this amplifier, however, I have to provide an account of my experience with it. I was an early purchaser of the JOB 225, and like a number of other early purchasers of this amplifier, I had a problem with 60 Hz hum emanating from the loudspeakers. When I contacted JOB Electronics (apparently a marque of the ultra-high-end brand Goldmund), the company at first seemed skeptical that there was a problem with the amplifier.<br /><br />Once JOB/Goldmund acknowledged the problem, however, the response was swift. JOB paid for return shipping to Switzerland and had my amplifier back in my possession within two business days. The problem with 60 Hz hum was gone. Reportedly, other users with humming JOB 225s will be able to ship their amplifiers to a service center in NYC for repair/modification.<br /><br />The repaired/modified JOB 225 sounds spectacularly transparent. Adding this amp to my system has expanded soundstage width and depth, and increased image specificity.<br /><br />Before purchasing this amp, keep in mind both that output power is limited and that the amp generates a lot of heat. Use with electrostatic or other difficult-to-drive speakers should be ruled out. Use with truly high-end speakers nevertheless appears possible. One user has reported extraordinary results with TAD CR-1s.<br /><br />In all, I'm pleased with my purchase. I would have rated it five stars if not for the initial 60 Hz hum problem.<br /><br />NOTE ON SHIPPING: Though Amazon reports an estimated delivery time several weeks away, I and all other JOB 225 users with whom I've communicated received our amps in a couple of business days via FedEx International Priority. Yes, you get shipping at Amazon Prime speed from Geneva for $70.\",\n",

I needed to repair an electronic item and work on some jewelry bits and this was amazing. I have smallish hands and this felt comfortable - no hand fatigue at all. There are three interchangeable heads (though so far I've only tried one). I will update the review with any issues on the other two as I try them.<br /><br />So, I think this would be a great item for people who work with all kinds of electronics, for hobbyists (the retro H.O. train enthusiast comes to mind), and for various other types of model making. I couldn't say if this has the chops to be a professional soldering iron for use day-after-day-after-day by a professional user but it's wonderful for the hobbyist who works more sporadically.<br /><br />In addition to the three interchangeable heads, Weller provides an iron stand, user manual (which I made very good use of), a soldering aid tool, lead-free solder, and is illuminated with little LED lights to keep the work surface illuminated.

Breastfeeding is wonderful, but it's also hard work - anything you can do to make it more convenient for mom is a great thing!<br /><br />I bought this for use with my newborn son.  To me, wanting to keep him close at night was very instinctive, but I wanted to ensure a safe way of doing it and a way that would eventually facilitate an easy-ish transition to crib sleeping.<br /><br />I especially wanted to be able to have easy access to him during the night so that he could nurse. This bassinet makes nighttime nursing as unobtrusive as possible. I hear my son as he wakes up and begins lightly fussing, and can get him out before he can escalate to crying.  I grab him, nurse him, and put him back to bed without really waking up at this point (extremely helpful when he decides to nurse nearly every hour because of a growth spurt!). I can easily see if he's making noises in his sleep versus awake and fussing - saves me a trip out of bed. The close proximity also gave me peace of mind in the beginning because I could check his breathing!<br /><br />We have two dogs who sleep on my husband's side of the bed; the co-sleeper makes me feel like my baby is separate from them and safe (they're great dogs, but I prefer to err on the side of caution).<br /><br />We use the leg extenders, which do as they say. They do make it slightly less stable, but I feel totally confident that the construction is solid. The wheels on one end are a nice touch.<br /><br />When setting up the bassinet, be sure to step down hard on all the sides - they're stiff and can easily be mistaken for locked when they're not.<br /><br />This bassinet does not collapse easily. We didn't buy it for that purpose, but it's still of note. I tried to collapse it for the first time last week to go to my parents' house and I felt like I was wrestling a bear!

My little guy doesn't seem to mind!<br /><br />It's handy that there are pockets on each end and I love the large storage compartment underneath. We keep extra sheets, extra leg extenders, an extra boppy cover, and more in there and there's tons of room to spare.<br /><br />I like the tan dot, it blends into our room and doesn't seem to take up a lot of space.<br /><br />Overall, a great option for babies and for saving parents getting out of bed repeatedly to get a baby when they're exhausted. Will continue to use this with my son until he grows out of it and plan to save it in hopes of baby number 2 in a few years.\",\n",

       " (\"I didn't buy these headphones from Amazon but I got it new from our campus bookstore.  Before I started using the SOL AMPS, I was a pretty committed SkullCandy user.  Specifically I had the SkullCandy Ink'd 2 and Smokin' Buds 2.  I honestly didn't have any problem with these except for the occasional times when they will fall apart.  I got the SOL AMPS for fun and I'm really glad I picked them out and this is why...<br /><br />DESIGN<br />I wanted something different from SkullCandy and I thought the style of these looked fun and unique.  The SOL logo on the side definitely looks attractive.  I also like how the buds are angled so you can get a better fit.  I was a little worried about the outer part being abnormally large and odd when they are in my ears, but it doesn't really bother me, and in fact it feels very comfortable...<br /><br />COMFORT<br />These are one of the best fitting ear headphones I've ever tried.  They are so comfortable that I sometimes forget I have them in my ears when the music isn't playing.  While the SkullCandy buds fits me fairly well, they don't fit other people when they ask to borrow my SkullCandy headphones.  However, the fitting of the SOL AMPS is perfect.  It feels very snug.  I have exercised (ex. running on treadmill, weightlifting, biking, etc.) using both SkullCandy and SOL AMPS and the SOL AMPS are superior by far.  I never feel like they are going to fall out no matter how much I sweat or move.  These headphones are definitely a plus in comfort.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY<br />The switch from SkullCandy to SOL AMPS is phenomenal.  I feel like I can hear a crisp sound compared to SkullCandy.  I love SkullCandy and thought it was great but wow these definitely give an additional boost to the bass.  The bass isn't overwhelming and it sounds just right.  I'm a person who listens a WIDE range of music (ex. Electronic, Rap, Country, to Classical) and the quality doesn't sound lost in all of the genres.<br /><br />MIC and VOLUME<br />I've used this for calls and skype and I never have problems talking or hearing people.  I sometimes have to hold the mic portion close to my mouth to make myself clearer but this isn't really a problem for me.  This is definitely a nice feature.<br /><br />Having the controls for the volume is so wonderful.  It definitely eliminates the hassle of taking taking out your phone (I have an iPhone) to adjust the volume or even shuffling music.  I use these buttons (almost as an abuse) because that's how convenient they are.  When I am using the SOL AMPS on the bus or any public areas, I never hear any background noises and in addition I can have the volume high without bothering the person who is next to me.<br /><br />PRICE<br />I bought these for a little more than what it is selling on Amazon.  I think these headphones are definitely worth the price!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a treat to an enjoyable experience.  Good job Sol Republic!\",\n",

This is stating the obvious, of course, but they contain peanut and tree nut (almond oil) ingredients.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, one serving is an ounce, which contains 120 calories (35 from fat). One serving has 0.5 grams of saturated fat but no cholesterol. One serving has 35 mg of sodium and 20 g of carbohydrates (very little fiber and about 10g of sugar). Finally, these have 3g of protein per serving and a tiny amount (about 2%) of iron. If I haven't mentioned something else that is commonly included on the nutrition part of the label, that's because it isn't in this product (i.e., no vitamin C).<br /><br />Texture-wise, these are very similar to the hard/crunchy kind of granola bars. These are broken into pieces maybe 1/2 inch square (not quite 1/2 inch thick). You do see big, whole peanut halves in these. I mostly notice the peanut flavor; the quinoa doesn't add much flavor and the ginger is more of a mild undertone (it's there, but not overpowering).<br /><br />Maybe it's because I haven't let myself eat too many snack foods lately or maybe not, but I think these things are delicious. I'd definitely consider buying these in the future (as well as looking for other flavors from the same company).\",\n",

So I'm more picky than most about bags.<br /><br />The colors on this are really great.  I love the way it looks, vibrant and bright with the greens, and the deep blue looks good as well.  There is padding not just on the straps, but on the back panel as well to protect your back and a laptop.  Unlike some that I've had, this one actually has a little bit of padding on the bottom of the laptop's sleeve as well.  That's a pet peeve of mine in laptop backpacks - when they don't have padding *where you set them down* all the time.<br /><br />I like the handle on top - some others I have just have smaller nylon straps as quick grab handles.  This one isn't very thick, but it works well.<br /><br />The downside for me is that there just aren't as many storage spots in here as I'd like.  Just the laptop sleeve in the rear most opening.  No pockets at all in the middle compartment.  And just two pockets, one zipper opening, and the tablet spot in the front opening.  Then there is the small zippered pouch on the top.  That's it.  Other than that one zipper comparement, the only thing that secures anything is the velcro strap for the laptop compartment.<br /><br />So for my use, it's too limited.  But for a student or someone with simpler needs, it really is a nice backpack.  It's comfortable, and those open spaces are great for books, change of clothes, or other things like that.  And I like that it has water bottle spots on both sides, since I like to carry some bottles of Lipton Iced Tea, and two is always better than one.<br /><br />The one odd thing missing isa small opening to feed earbuds or something through, so if you're a person who wants that, you'll need to settle for snaking the cord out through an opening in the zipper instead.<br /><br />Good backpack for the price.\",\n",

I was always curious about these dongles, and the product started earning five stars before it even arrived.

That alone is an unusually high level of service.<br /><br />When this adapter arrived today, I had it up and running - and connected to a bluetooth speaker - in less than ten minutes. Step one was to install the drivers on the accompanying CD ROM (I could have downloaded them had I been diskless), then the software itself. The wizard stepped me though discovering the devices to which I wanted to connect and I was done. A great feature is when you connect to a speaker it appears as a headset and you have the option of hands-free operation or not.<br /><br />As an experiment I decided to check if my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 would connect. It did. Unlike when the adapter streams music to a speaker, I could move files from my phone to my laptop via bluetooth.<br /><br />For the record I installed this on an ancient ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP, SP3. No problems and no issues.

The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily\\'s intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn\\'t take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily\\'s idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily\\'s newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily\\'s love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander\\'s exploration of Emily\\'s liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily\\'s character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband\\'s secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn\\'t know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband\\'s interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />\"Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me...\"<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they\\'re set in some amazing locales; however, I don\\'t believe I will be continuing this series.',\n",

       " ('There\\'s much more afoot here than what get more commonly delivered in the average Pinky/Pinku film (which this is and is not).  With an almost macabre `After-School Special\\' quality, FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING tries to be about more than the act of sex and/or the glorification of rape (a staple of many similar Japanese films, especially those under the `Female Teacher\\' label).  One of the characters remarks, by their nature, \"guppies make the best of bad situations,\" and that\\'s not a sentiment normally explored when the pursuit of skin is paramount.  Likewise, HUNTING frankly tries to say something about human nature - not just commenting separately on the roles for the male and female of the species - and it comes in the delivery of a smart script that tries to give some psychological underpinnings to the actions of its various players.<br /><br />At this point, let me add the noble aside of \"Yes, yes, if you\\'re only here for the simulated sex, there\\'s plenty for you to!\"<br /><br />(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you\\'re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I\\'d encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you\\'re accepting of few modest hints at `things to come,\\' then read on ...)<br /><br />Two students - Kuriyama Daisuke (played by Hajime Ishigami) and Murakami Midori (a girl, Kyoko Ito, looking a bit like a puckish Filipino boy - are skinny-dipping in the academy pool.  Though the audience isn\\'t shown, it\\'s clearly implied that they\\'re more than a bit frisky about the whole affair, and some unseen prankster is shown stealing Midori\\'s school uniform from the poolside where it sits.  However, the next day, rumors persist around the school that Kuriyama raped Midori.  Apparently hoping to preserve her reputation, Midori doesn\\'t come to her young beau\\'s defenses, leaving their teacher Miss Kyoko Sakatani (Yoko Azusa) to push for the boy\\'s possible prosecution.  School breaks before Kuriyama can prove his innocence - though not before he really does stick it to Midori for not defending him - and our cast go their separate ways ... but their story is just beginning.<br /><br />Kuriyama sulks about a seaside town where he\\'s taken in by a surly shopkeeper and his sultry mistress, and - before you can say one-two-three - he finds himself knee-deep in the weirdest menage a trois this side of Huey, Louie, and Dewey (never a legitimate menage, so far as I know, but a darn clever pun).  What we learn here is that the young man has lived a life exposed to some of deepest, darkest sexual exploitation perhaps known to a young mind, and, despite those circumstances, he\\'s done his best to repress giving in to them at school.  In the greater world outside, however, he eventually succumbs to these hot advances of a kinda/sorta would-be stepmother and earns his stripes amongst this kinky duo.  In the meantime, his school girlfriend Midori finds herself pestered by a curious phone prank who may know more about what really happened back at the pool; and the lovely but naïve Miss Sakatani spends the summer exploring her own sex life with a married man (the rape investigator) with a take-charge attitude.<br /><br />And, seriously ... that\\'s only half the story!<br /><br />HUNTING packs an awful lot of narrative into its slim, trim 65 minutes and still manages to deliver up the steamy scenes, some that are conventional lovemaking and others that flitter and flirt with sexual assault, so much so that it becomes impossible to decipher what it might all mean.  Director Junichi Suzuki directs a script from Hiroshi Saito that layers on the heavy insinuation that what\\'s really being exploited here are social role models (i.e. teachers as authority figures; students as hungry for learning and direction; rape case workers as doing what\\'s upright and honorable; etc.).  What becomes increasingly clear isthat the lines between consent versus dissent have grown increasingly blurred in a society prone to `hunting\\' for real meaning - who am I, what do I want, and how do I go about getting it.<br /><br />For example, Midori\\'s merry telephone prankster, Tanaka, has his own fetishistic hang-ups (fantasies) which cause him to start and spread the rumors about her being raped, and these essentially spring from his own inability to engage his classmate in a real-world relationship.  When forced to come to terms with them, he unsuccessfully sexually assaults Midori, but their conflict is far from over as we\\'ll eventually see him coaxed toward better results in a scene ripe with allegory (as well as one staged and shot with crisp, near-romantic angles by cinematographer Yonezo Maeda).<br /><br />But perhaps an even better example involves Miss Sakatani.  As the gallant teacher, she\\'s intent upon putting Kuriyama\\'s world in order, appealing to him in the picture\\'s opening to not drop out of school because of what he insists are rumors of his assault on Midori.  She wants the system to give the boy a chance to be found innocent.  Later in the film - when she realizes he indeed may be - she seeks him out, hoping to make things right.  What ends up happening is the young man rapes her - a startling development - but one not nearly as surprising as her reaction afterward when it appears she\\'s pleased with herself!  Away from her, Kuriyama vomits, coming to grips with what he\\'s become; away from him, Sakatani smiles, content that she\\'s finally made him into what she was led to believe he was.<br /><br />I hope I haven\\'t spoiled too much of the story here, but, as is often the case when folks explore Pinku films, it isn\\'t so much for the plot as it is the skin.  My only desire in discussing this further - much more than I usually do - is to point out that there was far more being explored here than in the traditional skin flick; and - in whatever small way - that underscored why I\\'moccasionally drawn to these films.  Too easily, they get dismissed as little more than pornography meant to instill whatever crass value system might be at work in an industry exploiting women for the sum of their body parts; but every now and then one comes along that challenges those biases - almost thumbs its nose at those assumptions - and, as implied by the title HUNTING, the cast and crew were trying something a bit different here.  That deserves to be pointed out.  As is your right, you don\\'t have to agree with the message; as is my right, I\\'m only challenging others to appreciate the effort.<br /><br />FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING (1982) is produced by Isao Hayashi for Nikkatsu.  DVD distribution stateside is being handled through Impulse Pictures under its popular \"Nikkatsu Erotic Films Collection\" imprint.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Japanese spoken-language film with English subtitles (no dubbing track available).  As for the technical specifications, it looks and sounds surprisingly solid for its modest age; director Junichi Suzuki should even be commended for incorporating some clever cinematography and curious sound editing choices to add greater depth to what could\\'ve otherwise ended up as a bloated, soap-opera-ish story.  As for the special features, the disc is light - it bears only the original theatrical trailer - but the packaging includes some wonderfully informative liner notes by noted expert on Japanese film, Jasper Sharp.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  If you understand the metaphor, then think of FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING as the Merchant Ivory of Pinky porn, with a script so layered and a climax so royally screwed up that Sigmeund Freud probably would\\'ve soiled himself trying to decipher the conflicting and conflicted messages.  Still, if your taste is anything from the Nikkatsu Erotic Films Collection, this one will definitely give you something to think about as its chocked full of talent who can actually act, a scriptthat tries to give erudite subtext to the sexuality it explores, and probably the worst `stepmother\\' figure in the history of film ... or the greatest, depending upon your predilections.<br /><br />In the interest of fairness, I\\'m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Impulse Pictures provided me with an advance DVD copy of FEMALE TEACHER HUNTING by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.',\n",

It does not, however, allow you to lay out flat, such as if you wanted lay on your stomach. You will need a true lawn chair for that. This chair is similar in operation to a recliner but it reclines further and puts your feet higher than most recliners do.<br /><br />Most of you are probably wondering about the length and size of the chair, so I will do my best to give you an idea. I am 6'1&#34;&#34; and 200 lbs. When I lay on the chair with my legs extended, the bottom bar rests under my achilles. However, I rarely sit like that - I usually use the bar as a foot rest and is one of my favorite features. If i do straighten my legs with my achilles on the bar it is not uncomfortable. Without the pillow, the top of my head would rest on the top bar. But since the pillow can be moved up pretty high, I would say it could accommodate someone even a little taller than me. I would not get the wide version because it would be unnecessarily more expensive and would put the armrests farther out. My father-in-law is 5'11&#34;&#34; 270 lbs and is also comfortable in this chair.<br /><br />These chairs fold up tightly and store easily in our garage when not in use. If you grab the right part (turn them sideways and grab the middle bar) it carries easily with one hand.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the grips slipping when the chair partially reclined. I have noticed this too, but only if I'm moving around, like if I lean forward to reach for something. When I'm leaned back into the chair, the chair is centrally balanced and doesn't slipfor me. If I notice that the grips have moved, I just readjust and re-tighten. The grips are right by your hands so this isn't hard to do. Overall, this hasn't been an irritation for me.<br /><br />I am glad I read other peoples comments about rust. Mine are usually under our covered patio, but I would not allow these sit out in the rain uncovered. The outside metal is water treated, but the inside is not, so the inside could collect water, rust, and potentially spill onto your clothes or something else.<br /><br />Have owned them for two years and still love em.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful.

Jerry Seinfeld chose to end the series after nine years, it wasn\\'t due to falling ratings. [The book says there was criticism about the stories.] This book covers Jerry\\'s life from childhood to a national television star in 19 chapters. It has an `Episode Guide\\' to the 179 episodes and an `Index\\'. It tells about the stand-up comedians and the business of comedy in the 1980s. The show ran from May 1990 to May 1998. Was it \"a show about nothing\" as some said? It portrayed (or mocked) the lives of the personal servants of the rich and their problems. Did many of its audience identify with these characters and their problems? Did they know people like them? Or was it because it dealt with topics censored from the usual TV comedies? [I was not a fan and seldom watched the shows.]<br /><br />One example of its influence is on page 133 where an executive employee was fired for discussing an episode. A wrongful termination lawsuit awarded him $26 million. Euphemisms may work in a controlled TV show but have unwanted effects in the real world. Was this double-entendré part of the appeal of the show? Episodes dealt with the events of everyday life but looked at them from a humorous viewpoint. Can parking in a handicap-only spot generate humor? Its not funny to a handicapped person who needs that spot! Dealing with topics not usually discussed is certainly daring. It also dealt with ordinary problems, life finding your car in a huge parking garage. [Write down the location on a piece of paper.] It warned about the need to safeguard your financial records (\"The Truth\"). [Use a copying machine.]<br /><br />Jerry was born in 1954 and spent a lot of time watching TV (Chapter 1). [That TV station in NYC (p.3) now shows reruns of \"Seinfeld\" at night after prime time.] He graduated from Queens College in 1976 with a double major in theater and communication arts; then started as a stand-up comic (Chapter 2). The 1980s saw hundreds of comedy clubs started (Chapter 3). [There is a lot of details about the comedy business here.] Jerry appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" in 1981. His career grew (Chapter 4). He was a clean comic. Jerry could earn as much as \"the mid-five figures per week\" (p.48). Jerry built up a car collection (p.51). [Some inner hunger?] Jerry got together with Larry David to work on an NBC show about conversation (Chapter 5). Characters were based on people they knew. NBC ordered four more shows (p.63). Jerry\\'s job as performer, producer, and writer was a heavy workload. The remaining fifteen chapters continue the story of this successful comedy show. Chapter 14 tells Jerry\\'s idea of a perfect girlfriend. Read Chapter 15 for more details.<br /><br />Can this show ever be copied? For what reason? Shows are aimed at the 18 to 49 year olds because they have the most disposable income and spend their money more freely (p.111). Would you like these characters as neighbors or friends or co-workers? Too self-absorbed? What has changed after 15 years?

This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.<br /><br />Besides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).

Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.<br /><br />They are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.

       " ('So here was my predicament: I didn\\'t really wanted to have a Wii U. I thought I had grown out of my Nintendo phase. The last Nintendo system I had was the GameCube more than 10 years ago, and I hardly ever played it. Gone were the heyday of my Super Nintendo and Mario Kart, Street Fighter, and Bomberman after-school parties. Then one day while reading up on my video game news, I saw the trailer for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda. I swore I had never seen anything more beautiful, and instantly I was hooked. I don\\'t remember the last time ONE game made me want to buy a game console right away. So I sought out to see which \"set\" I would buy. The standard basic and deluxe sets were out of the question, and I saw this one. Then I read up on the Mario Kart 8 set, which is supposed to be sold for $330. I searched furiously all over the Net for it. I even wrote scathing reviews for those sets on Amazon, because for some reason Amazon doesn\\'t sell them, and worse yet, let those marketplace sellers run their mark-up scams and sell it for over $400. After two weeks and no luck - Walmart, BestBuy, GameStop, and even Toys R\\' Us didn\\'t have them in stock anymore - I had to resort to buy this set from my local BestBuy.<br /><br />Here is my scenario to give you the best value, as of this writing - July 12, 2014. I have included direct links to the products for quicker access.<br /><br />1) Get this set for $300. Get it from other online stores if you have to. The cheapest Prime seller on here is $305.<br />2) Buy Mario Kart 8 for $49-([[ASIN:B00DC7G2W8 Mario Kart 8 - Nintendo Wii U]]). This game comes with a code to get you one of four free games. Since Pikmin 3-([[ASIN:B0050SWBAE Pikmin 3]]) is the most expensive right now - $50 - save that for the free game.<br />3) If you want the Wii controller that\\'s included in the Mario Kart set, buy Wii U Party for $43-([[ASIN:B00DC7FWRE Wii Party U]]), which includes the controller.<br />4) Buy the ([[ASIN:B002MGPAKU Nintendo Wii Wheelfor Mario Kart (Black) x 2 Bundle]]) for $9.<br /><br />Optional:<br /><br />5) Buy Zelda: Wind Waker HD for about $41-([[ASIN:B002I0GF72 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD]]). The Wonderful 101 is only $24([[ASIN:B002I08CSW The Wonderful 101]]). Super Mario 3D World is $49-([[ASIN:B00DC7G0GG Super Mario 3D World - Nintendo Wii U]]), and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is $44-([[ASIN:B00DC7O77A Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze - Nintendo Wii U]]). All of these games mentioned are the cheapest prices(here on Amazon) for a big online store.<br />6) If you want the Wii U Pro controller, get the Japanese import version, which saves you about $10($40)-([[ASIN:B009AP2518 Wii U PRO controller (shiro) (WUP-A-RSWA)]]). It\\'s the exact same as the US one, only with Japanese documentation.<br /><br />If you do my method, it would cost you $400 for the whole set, which includes Mario Kart 8, Wii U Party, and the Wii controller and wheel add-on. This is $70 more than the Mario Kart set, but then you don\\'t have to wait until who knows when for that set to be available again, plus you gain Super Mario Bros U/Super Luigi U that comes with the Deluxe Set, and Wii U Party, which make up the price difference. You can resell those two extra games if you don\\'t want to keep them. Hope that helps! Good luck!<br /><br />*As of the Wii U itself, I love, Love, LOVE my Wii U! I can finally relive my childhood past. The included Mario/Luigi games bring back the nostalgia of the original Nintendo, only this time the graphics are soooo gorgeous. I can just stare at it all day while a friend plays it. I also bought Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and the Wonderful 101, and all have been a joy and a blast to play, each in their unique way. The feeling the Wii U gives you is night and day different than my PS4 or PC. While the other two systems offer the mature entertainment my grown-up phase has moved on to, there will always be a place in my heart for Nintendo games, and the Wii U provides allthat for me, and in spades. Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto was right when he said \"Nintendo\" is its own unique genre. Nowhere else can you get games like the Mario games, Mario Kart, the Yoshi/Toad/Kirby/Donkey Kong games. More importantly, they all have their own unique style and feel that no other games can give you. You can read more about that article at [nintendolife.com/news/2014/06/miyamoto_thinks_that_nintendo_are_in_a_genre_of_their_own]. The closest recent game that can even say to be similar that\\'s available across all systems is Rayman. And then there\\'s the eNintendo shop, which further allows you to play those legacy games in their original state. So far I\\'ve bought The Legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past, and The Minish Cap, and both have been awesome to play, and is almost exactly how I remembered it. And finally, there\\'s a rewards system on Club Nintendo where you earn points for registering your games and systems. These points then can be used to redeem for free games. And then, if you reach 300 points, you will be at Gold status, which would earn you further freebies at the end of the Nintendo year (June 30 of each year), and 600 points gets you to Platinum status. I registered my Wii U, Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and The Wonderful 101, and I\\'m already at Gold level! For more info, you can check out [club.nintendo.com/elite-status-gifts.do].<br /><br />If you were holding off on buying a Wii U - like me - well, now is the perfect time to get back into it, especially with Mario Kart just coming out, plus all those great games coming at the end of the year and next year, like the aforementioned upcoming Legend of Zelda.<br /><br />DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!',\n",

The gains in energy efficiency have been well documented by this point and as of the summer of 2014, I've yet to have any of my 7-8 LED bulbs go out on me which isn't surprising since they are supposed to last for years.<br /><br />So what I'm looking for in good LED bulb at this point is the function of the dimmer capabilities and the warmth (aka temperature) of the bulb.  My biggest issue with LED's is that they can still be a bit harsh inside, even the warm white (2700K) bulbs.<br /><br />As far the dimmer capabilities go, this bulb is top notch...it dims quickly and is sensitive enough to work fairly well with my dimmer.  You do have to turn it on at least medium to activate the light but then it will go lower and dimmer than most of my other LED bulbs.  Regarding temperature, I've found that all 2700K bulbs are not created equal.  This one is warmer and softer than other 27K LED's that I have, but they haven't gotten it as warm as I would like in an ideal situation.  Overall, I still like using LED for the energy savings and I would recommend the Bulbrite bulb if you are looking for an LED.\",\n",

Well written, unusual storyline, exceptional characters, honest and heartfelt dialogue, diverse supporting cast, strong family theme, angst-filled romance, and the author writes very sensitively about the loss of a loved one and the shattered emotional state of those left behind.  HOWEVER, this book is difficult book to read in places, the honesty of the emotions that play out in the book, touch the reader to the point of sadness.<br /><br />THIS STORY follows dedicated ER doctor, Rachel Culver, and firefighter, Cale Jackson, in the aftermath of the tragic death of Noelle Culver, Rachel's twin sister and Cale's fiancée.  During the intervening eighteen months since Noelle's death, Cale has struggled to deal with his loss, but Rachel has simply filled her life with work and study to avoid grieving and feeling guilty about the fight she had with her sister the night she died.  Everyone recognizes the Rachel must face the pain and emptiness of losing her twin, but it is Cale who tries to reach her and share the reality of their loss, in hopes that both of them can move on (cvpl).<br /><br />OVERALL, a engaging storyline, but it is the heartfelt emotions that make this a good read.  This is not a easy, quick fix plot, grieve today - gone tomorrow, but a touching story of facing a deeply felt loss and surviving that loss to love again.  THE TEXAS FIREFIGHTERS series includes Playing With Fire, A Little Consequence, Fully Involved, Burning Ambition, Island Haven, After the Storm, and A Time for Us.<br /><br />You may enjoy the complex characters and storytelling of N.

I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.<br /><br />Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that's good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.<br /><br />This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.<br /><br />Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.<br /><br />One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.<br /><br />Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down.When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.<br /><br />All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns. I would definite recommend it to my friends.\",\n",

       " (\"The G1077M is part of the Gitzo Classic Center Ball Head series, marketed as a petite head for travelers and matched to their carbon fiber Mountaineer tripods. I bought it in 2004 to use on a Gitzo G1028 Mountaineer. My gripped EOS 10D and 17-40 4L USM zoom were too close to the 4.4 LB load limit and I was fighting drifting in portrait orientation. So rather than struggle with every angle, I bought the next size up, the Gitzo G1177M, rated to 8.8 LB. All it needed was a modest amount of torque and the angle was locked. The G1177M became my favorite head and traveled with me for a decade.<br /><br />The wee G1077M languished for years in a desk drawer, unused and forgotten. I started shooting with an Olympus E-P3 micro 4/3 system and needed a small tripod to complement it. So I installed the G1077M on my Manfrotto 209B table top tripod and the combo was magic: balanced, light and smooth as silk. And no drift whatsoever. The E-P3 felt like it belonged on that head. Although the E-P3 is metal and armed with an EVF and fast prime, it's still a lightweight compared to even a petite DSLR.<br /><br />So while the G1077M is not well suited for heavy DSLRs, it is ideal for compact cameras like M4/3 or point 'n shoot, and at its best mounted on a table top tripod like a Manfrotto 209B or Giottos QU500. In a pinch, a DSLR works fine on the G1077M as long as you stick to horizontal orientation.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION: Most metal parts are magnesium for strength and minimal weight. The ball housing sports an attractive sliver and black speckle enamel and, after years of use, has proved to be surprisingly chip and scratch resistant. The bottom is tapped for a standard 3/8 inch tripod mount thread. The top platform has a 1/4 inch bolt for mounting a camera.<br /><br />A single large knob is used for locking the ball. There is no separate tension knob. To mount a camera you loosen it and turn the top platform until the screw is snug. The platform is large and knurled for a sure grip even in wet weather.<br /><br />One odd thing I noticed while everything was apart was the ball is hollow and I could look down the stem and see out the bottom. Probably the hollow ball is a weight saving measure.<br /><br />KIRK QR Clamp Install: I have Arca-Swiss quick release plates on all my cameras so I decided to add a small Kirk QR clamp to the G1077M [[ASIN:B006U43AMA Kirk Enterprises 1'' Quick Release Clamp]]. First I screwed it into the 1/4 bolt on top of the disk. I soon realized the disk was redundant and removed it, mounting the Kirk clamp directly on the ball stem. The appearance is OEM and the operation is smooth, fast and natural. The installation of the Kirk clamp on the stem was harder than expected due to Locktite on the threads. I had to hold the stem still with a small pliers (with cloth to keep from scratching it) and unscrew the disk with rubber gloves for extra grip. The 1/4 inch stud had Locktite too and I had to use the pliers to remove it too. I cleaned off the Locktite and repositioned the stud so the top was flush with the top of the Kirk clamp (& deeper in the stem). And, yes, I applied a wee bit of Locktite 242 to keep the rig from turning under load. So 30 minutes of toil but what a great lightweight combo!<br /><br />LOAD CAPACITY: This is only a 120 g head and rated for light duty loads of 4.4 pounds, albeit the true capacity is much lower. I've owned heads from Manfrotto, Gitzo, Sunwayfoto and Really Right Stuff and they all greatly exaggerate load capacity. The Manfrotto and Gitzo heads tend to lock securely at about 50% of their rated load capacity. Indeed, I found about 2 LBs to be the true capacity while using the drop slot or at a steep angle. I recently tested a [[ASIN:B00AMNWXDW SUNWAYFOTO FB-28 Mini Tripod Ball Head Arca Compatible 7 oz Sunway FB28]], rated at 26 LB, and found the true capacity to be about 2 LB as well.<br /><br />LAST BLURB: The weight and space conscious traveler desiring a high quality head for point'n shoot and M4/3 cameras can't go wrong with the G1077M. And it is even better with the Kirk QRC-1 mounted topside, making for fast and secure connections. The Gitzo-Kirk pairing appears OEM and the combined operation is smooth, fast and natural.<br /><br />Finally, many will question why would anybody in their right mind spend upwards of $160 for a table top tripod. I certainly wouldn't if I didn't already own a G1077M. Nevertheless, this rig is light, fits in my jean pocket and provides amazingly solid support for my Olympus E-P3 camera.\",\n",

       " ('This is not a sensational account of the ax-murder of eight innocent people in the town of Villisca, Iowa, in 1912. If you are looking for lurid graphics, you\\'ll have to look elsewhere. This is more the story of a typical, turn-of-the-century rural town.<br /><br />Villisca was a Thornton Wilder \"Our Town\" of a place, but one whose gentle clickety-clack through time got derailed by a bizarre murder. The town\\'s railroad and its comfortingly scheduled passings indeed set the tone for this sober account. However, the train might also have been instrumental in delivering a killer to the Moores\\' doorstep one dark night.<br /><br />It\\'s strange how some murders, like the Lizzie Borden ax-murders, remain in our collective memory and even become part of our vernacular, our common pool of referenced happenings. Meanwhile, other much more shocking and mysterious murders, such as this one, are forgotten by everyone except local people. Some of the film\\'s commentators speculate on such disparities in sustained interest. This documentary brings the tragedy of Villisca out of the shadows, but in the context of the town\\'s larger life.<br /><br />A number of Villisca locals, children at the time of the murders, appear in this documentary, filmed through the 1990\\'s and early 2000\\'s. These elders give first-hand accounts of the days preceding the murders - and the whirlwind of days that followed it. They talk about the heightened suspicion and prejudice that infected the town, reinforcing laws against members of minority groups being allowed to stay there overnight. They talk about the sequence of people who were suspected of the crime.<br /><br />The killings had some distinctive ritualistic, sexual aspects. So the town\\'s primary suspicions might seem ludicrously misguided to us today. We\\'ve been well-informed by CSI shows about the likely psychological profile of such a killer - and that profile hardly fit the man upon whom the town settled their conviction of guilt for a while. It\\'s also hard to understand why a series of similar killings in other towns eventually came to be deemed irrelevant to the Villisca case. However, the elders who appear here tell about the business rivalries and the illicit romances that were tacit common knowledge in 1912 Villisca - and which then got hung out on the clothes lines as what seemed like obvious motives for murder after the fact.<br /><br />These first-hand accounts and the accounts of researchers are generously interspersed with sepia photographs of that 1912 time and place. \"Villisca\" becomes reminiscent of a Ken Burns documentary.<br /><br />There are a lot of good extras on this DVD.  These include two excellent commentaries. The commentary by local researcher-historian Edgar Epperly provides an especially literate, evocative accompaniment to a crime that is at once so far-removed from us, and yet so affecting. This is an intelligent, absorbing film on all levels.',\n",

The UV-B5 has slightly less channels (99), but has a channel knob instead of the LED flashlight. Programming is a little easier, but like the UV-5R, you'll want to buy the optional programming cable. Using the software from Baofeng, you can also expand the UHF RX frequency range to 520MHZ. The latest daily builds of CHIRP also work, but not the advanced settings or programming above 470MHZ (as of June, 2013). The UV-B5's operating manual is light years better than the operating manual that comes with the UV-5R, and also has a much better antenna.<br /><br />Performance wise, the UV-B5 is on par with my radios costing 3 times more. Transmit and receive are both excellent. Build quality is a step below the more expensive Japanese radios, and the scan speed is slower, but that should be expected from a dual-band radio costing under $50. Audio is excellent, and plenty loud from the small speaker. The 2000mAh battery lasts a long time. Unfortunately, the battery and charger are not compatible with the UV-5R. The programming cable is.<br /><br />This is just a great, cheap, dual-band radio.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price!!<br />Very good audio on TX and RX.<br />Good battery life.<br />Good sensitivity and selectivity.<br />Great features.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As of June 2013, radio is still only available from overseas dealers.<br />Programming cable not included.<br />Very quirky programming without the cable.<br />Channel skip is only available using the programming software.<br />SMA Female antenna instead of standard SMA Male antenna.<br />Very slow scan speed.\",\n",

       " ('I was waiting for this 2012 model TV since I saw it at CES expo, because this 80 inch is the largest 240hz 3d TV so far. I didn\\'t expected this TV to release in March, 2012.    Anyways I bought it from Amazon via Paul\\'s TV for $4472+tax (Los angeles tax=8.75%). Cost me total of $4863.57 with free \"white glove\" fast delivery. Ordered on Saturday March 31st, and got it delivered on Monday April 2nd, barely just like next day delivery.    Considering myself a smart shopper, I actually did some research for the price check. All other places were $1000 or more even at my favorite Frys electronics store, but I still went to Frys electronics to see this TV in action, but Frys personnel said it hasn\\'t been put on display yet, as it\\'s been barely 3 days since they recieved this model. Anyhow I told them at Amazon it\\'s cheaper price, and they were just amazed! to see the price difference. The have to call their manager to match it up. Finally they were able to match it up but they came up with delivery fee of $75.00. I still wanted to go with it but somehow I just remembered that being a Chase freedom credit card customer, I get an additional 5% cash back on purchases made from Amazon.com for the first quarter of 2012. So I end up buying at amazon.com for bigger savings and free shipping with white glove delivery.    Next day amazon bumped up the price for this TV. Lucky enough, I saved ridiculously $1000 just in overnight. I bet you they realized that they were selling the TV for a cheaper price than any other competitors.    Let\\'s get to the point of Cons and Pros of this TV discussing some key features and comparing with my other Samsung 55inch 8000 led series of 2010 model.    Pros: It plays MKV format out of the box. Built in WiFi. Web browser.  Dedicated button for Netflix on remote. Hulu plus,YouTube with HD feature, Vudu, etc. Active 3D not like other 3D TV manufacturers which use passive technology. It\\'s 240hz and motion plus to 480Hz, with contrast Ratio of 1:10 million. DLNA certified. More speaker output power of an additional 15 Watts of Bass as compared to all other LED TV manufacturers.    Cons: It won\\'t connect to portable Hard drive via USB. It only connects to electric powered hard drive and flash memory sticks (as written in instruction manual). When watching over the air channels via HD antenna, it won\\'t give you detailed description of the TV program you are watching except the name of the program. It won\\'t give you any info of the TV episode program in advance, that what is going to come next unlike my Samsung TV does. When using DLNA networking, it won\\'t play MKV files. It only plays MKV files via when using USB port but not with portable hard drive as I said above.    Rest if you want to buy any HDMI cables, or wall mount brackets, then I suggest you to buy at [...]. They are simply the cheapest.    Any suggestions or questions are most welcomed.',\n",

They were set out around the venue to water the guests.  I thought they were a little pricey for a 5 gallon bucket but we were tired of those cheap 5 gallon Pet mate plastic jugs that kept breaking. And they are not that cheap once you break 5 or 6 of them. How can you clean the algae out of those things anyway?  But I digress, so If I was at work, my wife could barely lift that 5 gallon jug , invert it and plant it squarely into the base without breaking the jug or spilling water everywhere. So I bought a Critter Cooler and now I have two, one for inside one for outside, our daughter has a 3.5 gallon, our neighbor has one and we bought another 6.5 gallon and donated it to our local animal shelter. These things are awesome.. I love the little yellow plug so we can drain the bowl and clean the drool and gunk without wasting the water in the tank.. The wheels are high quality, at the Home Depot they would cost about $7 each. And when we got our daughter her Critter Cooler, it was missing a valve, so we called the company and the owner, James, called us back and apologized, sent the part priority mail that day and included a bottle of his dog shampoo.

Both of these claim to have superior screens and cameras.  It is true that both have cameras with greater megapixels - but a million megapixel camera on a 1mm screen is still going to receive insufficient levels of light to make a halfway decent photograph.  I took pictures with all three and realized very quickly that the HTC One, with its 5 megapixel dual camera, produced higher quality photographs than the others.<br /><br />Then I tested their screens.  It wasn't a hard sell.  I popped up several videos from different sources (youtube, vimeo, amazon) and played them on all three.  The LG and Samsung phones had surprisingly grainy screens, while the HTC One screen was quite clear.<br /><br />The HTC One is also good on size.  I do not have to strain to see anything or use the screen.  The speakers were slightly better quality than the LG and Samsung.  The battery also lasts a very long time, especially when I change it to Energy Saver mode, which makes it so it doesn't vibrate every time I type something into it.<br /><br />All in all, I find that the HTC One m8 is a better smartphone.\",\n",

What amazed me was how much I grew to enjoy the series as I watched it more and more throughout the series story, it gives a nice abundance of action,comedy,drama,heartache,tragedy and a touch of romance.  Also the array of endearing cast of characters also made the series very enjoyable throughout the show, as you come to care for some and dislike others which in itself is what makes a great series when you endear yourself to the characters and villains alike.  The animation felt a little reminiscent of a couple of other series Last Exile and Eureka Seven so if you've seen either one you might sense a case of deja vu when you watch the series,also the voice cast did a terrific job in their character roles both for the dubbed and subbed.  The extras aren't much at most just the usual trailers and textless intro/ending songs,  if you already got the first set then you've seen that the case box is just hardened cardboard to fit the two part series dvd cases into which while looking nice isn't anything really special except to a hardcore anime collector fan.

The design of the earbuds also makes them good for exercise. However, as I\\'ve only used them while briskly walking, I can\\'t say for sure how they will do while running or doing more strenuous exercise. However, the headphones do come equipped with a small clip (like a microphone clip) that can clip on to a piece of clothing.<br /><br /> In terms of aesthetics, I don\\'t like the look of these headphones. It\\'s not a terrible design, but even in the black color I just don\\'t find them as visually pleasing as other headphones I\\'ve used and seen.<br /><br />While listening to music are a video with the headphones on, the sound doesn\\'t escape the headphones unless the volume is turned up extremely high.

Their portrayal reminded me of the characters from my own travels and the characters in my current classroom; most importantly, they evoked real emotion.<br /><br />Frustration, pride, loneliness, disappointment, and elation are feelings that I believe anyone who has traveled or taught can relate to. These are circumstances of so much good and so much unknown. While reading Abbey's story, I felt 23 again--I remembered the realization that teaching was way more then theory--I remembered feeling so hopelessly out of place in a foreign country that I wanted to disappear--I remembered the freedom that comes with embarking on an adventure--and I remembered how often the resolutions of change come throughout a lifetime.<br /><br />It's hard to graduate college and find your place in a grown up world. It's hard to move away from home. It's hard to know yourself well enough to predict where you will be at the end of every road.

I can tell you that this ab wheel is a good price compared to those in store models and its good quality, I have had no issues with it despite tons of use.<br /><br />I've been trying to lose weight for six months now and have made pretty good progress. As with any weight loss program it all comes down to eating right, exercising and supplements. Ive never been good at going to the gym so I decided to buy products like this so I can easily workout at my house. So my routine includes pullups, resistance band exercises, pushups and cardio. The cardio helps me to get in shape and burn fat, I usually do some sprints/intervals or some longer distance running. the exercise bands, pushups and pullups help to build muscle and define the muscle. And then the ab wheel helps with my core, keeping a strong core is very important in running as well as just normal day life. I work at a desk so ad exercises help a ton with keeping good posture in a very sedentary job. The ab wheel is NOT easy, I know some people may see it and think they wont get a workout but if you do it right and keep good form you will most certainly feel it. After the first few times using it I was sore for the next day! NOT easy. But if you want results thats what you need.<br /><br />On top of my current workout needs i have also been eating healthy. This healthy eating is mainly towards losing weight so thats the focus of many of my habits. For instance upon waking up I drink a protein shake and eat a banana for breakfast, protein is great in the morning when you are trying to lose weight. 30g within 30 min of waking up is ideal. In total I stick to about 2200 calories a day and try and stay away from processed foods although sometimes it is tough. I also take a supplement called [[ASIN:B00GA200WU Raspberry Ketones ]] which help you lose more weight by burning more fat and raising your metabolism. That combined with the protein shake in the morning help a ton. The protein also has the effect of keeping you fuller longer which helps me make it to lunch time without craving snacks.\",\n",
